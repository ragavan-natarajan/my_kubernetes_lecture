# Kubernetes: From Beginner to Expert

This repository contains the materials I prepared as part of Kubernetes training
I offered at Schlumberger, working as Software Architect. I offer this content
under the [Creative Commons Attribution NonCommercial NoDerivatives 4.0

## Important Note:

The materials presented in this content are completely my own, with citations
provided wherever necessary. The opinions in any of the documents in this
material are strictly my own and *does not* reflect the opinions of any of my

## How is this course different?

There are thousands of tutoritals online on Kubernetes. I try to take a
different approach in teaching Kubernetes in this course, and I call it the
__Problems before solutions__ approach. Every topic presented in this series
would be motivated by problems and the difficult ways that existed to solve
those problems, before better approaches and solutions are presented to the
audience. I see this style lacking in many of the __how-to__ style online
tutorials. People get to learn how to do things, but not why do it that way.

## Content outline:

The content outline provided below is not set in stone. As I prepare the
materials I might split a topic into two lectures, or merge two lectures into
one. For now, it should provide a broad overview of what is covered.

3. Containers, Part 2
4. Pods, and ReplicaSets
5. Namespaces, Labels, and Annotations
6. DaemonSets
